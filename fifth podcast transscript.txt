Welcome to the fifth podcast for the Allan Drive Gazette my name is Zuri's and I have my assistant here which is very new his name is Nathan yes and we will be interviewing one of my other assistants for the Allan Drive Gazette I hope you remember his name because we are welcoming Jonathan here hello so Jonathan what was your role in the Madagascar Jr play I was a zookeeper and a man lemur okay did you get stage Frights a little bit definitely in the first performance but then after that I got a lot better how did you enjoy the rehearsals they were fun they were fun like the people from the last podcast said you know sometimes you want to go outside but it was in the end it was worth it yeah it was really worth it yeah why did you audition in the first place so I wanted to get involved in acting in the summer in the summer before the play I was looking into any theater clubs that I could join and then when the play came around I auditioned

how are the performances to you on it because honestly I think they were pretty much a big hassle cuz everyone was getting really tired and I smelled a lot of sweat in that music room so tell me how were the performances they were good they were certainly tiring I had to get to bed early all of those nights it was very tiring you know you're dancing and singing for the entire time it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun too yeah I honestly think plays can be a lot of fun especially since I'm through playing around with that technology there was pretty fun so actually how would you rate your experience from 1 to 10 nine and a half why is that well it was it was the main reason is because it was a lot of fun but the reason why I didn't give it a 10 is because there was a lot of work that was put into it and yeah yeah was it stressful leading up to the performances this is another reason why I didn't give it a 10 it was it was very stressful yeah it was a lot of stressfulness you know for the last four episodes everyone said it was stressful you you remember because you were part of it yeah I'm normally the assistant but because we aren't going to cuz we aren't getting as many people to interview the tables of kind of turn yeah it would be nice if Lasha got to interview you know yeah that would be really nice yeah because everyone wants to know about the main character of The Story So they would like to know what happened so we want Lasha to join so last year if you're hearing this then please come out to us and please get an interview because we need you because you're the main character and if you're the main character you got to be interviewed so did your parents come to the performances yep my sister came to the first performance that was with JB and Ellwood and then my two brothers and my parents came for the performance after that how old is your brother honestly I really old siblings my brother my first brother he is he is both of my brothers are in University yeah okay so did you like the microphones like the microphones we heard are very itchy on some people so did you enjoy the microphones I enjoyed them yeah it was nice not having to project your voice to the back of the gym you know really really loudly the microphone certainly did help but at the same time the tape was kind of falling off of my face and actually I don't know if you remember this but after the break before the together forever song when I wasn't on stage I would go down and then Danny would give me some tape more tape because if it was more sticky then it would be more painful to get off so you know there has to be that Medium yeah it's not like a Band-Aid that's going to be hard to read but it's not like normal tape that's easy to fall off and yeah but I realize that you're my kept getting on mute yeah so I would like to ask you the final question that everyone wants to know and you already know this and you're smirking because you already know this what are some inspirational words that you would like to say to the other people out there

Try new things because those new things may be really good okay that was a short one but it was a very good one do you have anything more to say before we end off the podcast like a question for me or anything thank you you're welcome thank you for tuning in to the fifth podcast for the Allan Drive Gazette and like always have a nice day bye
